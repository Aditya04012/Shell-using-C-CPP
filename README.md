Features
--------

1.**Inbuilt Commands** ✅
- `cd`: Navigate between directories.
- `ls`: List directory contents.
- `echo`: Output text to the terminal.
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `exit`: Exit the shell.
- `cat`: Concatenate and display file contents.

Additional inbuilt commands can be added or customized.

2.**External Commands** ✅
The shell supports external commands, which are executed from the system’s PATH. Some commonly used external commands include:
- `grep`: Search for patterns within files.
- `curl`: Transfer data from or to a server.
- `man`: Display manual pages for commands.
- `python`: Execute Python scripts.
- `gcc`: Compile C programs.

3. **Piping** ✅
This shell supports piping (`|`), allowing you to pass the output of one command as the input to another. Example:
```
$ ls | grep "pattern"
```

4. **Redirection** ✅
The shell supports input and output redirection:
- Output Redirection (`>`): Directs the output of a command to a file (overwrites).
  ```
  $ echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt
  ```
- Append Redirection (`>>`): Appends the output of a command to a file.
  ```
  $ echo "More text" >> output.txt
  ```
- Input Redirection (`<`): Takes input for a command from a file.
  ```
  $ sort < unsorted.txt
  ```

5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility** ✅
This shell is designed to work on both Linux and Windows platforms. For Windows, the shell leverages compatibility layers to ensure that it functions seamlessly across both environments.

6. **Performance**✅
The shell is lightweight and optimized for performance. It provides fast execution for both simple and complex commands.
